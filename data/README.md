Different vegetation requires different optimal parameters. parameters.csv provides the optimal spacing between planet, optimal pH, optimal temperature ranges, humidity range and hour of light required by each type of vegetable. Hour of light has three categories: long (12 hours), normal (8 hours), short (4 hours), days to germination, days to maturity

pH affects nutrient absorption of plants, so it is important to maintain the optimal pH in water, especially when growing different varieties of vegetables within the same system.

Seed germination temperature also varies from vegetable to vegetable. In general, optimal germination temperature range is about the same as the optimal growth temperature range, therefore the parameters.csv includes only one optimal temperature range.

Some vegatation tastes bitter under high temperature in the growing environment, e.g. lettuce. So it is important to maintain optimal temperature to have best taste vegetation.

Spacing is important to have optimal vegetable growth and efficient use of space in growth area.

Days to germination and maturity are based on optimal temperature range.
